**Year:** 2025 | **Venue:** arXiv | **Citations:** N/A | **Score:** 0.240

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23551v1) | > We consider null geodesics in the background of spherically symmetric object in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory with coupling function $f(Φ)=e^{-2λΦ}$. The spherical solution is characteristically described by dilaton coupling $λ$, integrated dilaton flux $D$ and magnetic charge $P$. Then, we derive geodesic equations by using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. The radial photon orbital equation ...
