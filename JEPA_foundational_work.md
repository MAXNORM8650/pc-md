> Contemporary AI systems increasingly offer natural-language explanations of their behavior. These explanations are often teleological: they describe what the system “wants”, “tries”, or “is meant to do”. Teleological language can be useful as a form of narrative compression for humans, but it also invites anthropomorphism and miscalibrated trust. At the same time, recent work on world models and J...

Clustering is one of the key techniques in unsupervised learning analysis, aimed at grouping similar data objects into clusters based on shared characteristics. The broad benefits of clustering are evident across various sectors, such as business, marketing, finance, and many others. However, the complexity of implementing clustering, especially for those without a background in statistics ...

## 587. The variety of orthogonal frames

**Authors:** Laura Casabella, Alessio Sammartano

**Year:** 2025 | **Venue:** arXiv | **Citations:** N/A | **Score:** 0.000

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25058v1) | > An orthogonal n-frame is an ordered set of n pairwise orthogonal vectors. The set of all orthogonal n-frames in a d-dimensional quadratic vector space is an algebraic variety V(d,n). In this paper, we investigate the variety V(d,n) as well as the quadratic ideal I(d,n) generated by the orthogonality relations, which cuts out V(d,n). We classify the irreducible components of V(d,n), give criteria f...

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25074v1) | > Randomness generation through quantum-chaotic evolution underpins foundational questions in statistical mechanics and applications across quantum information science, including benchmarking, tomography, metrology, and demonstrations of quantum computational advantage. While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level...

## 589. Classification of Interacting Topological Crystalline Superconductors in Three Dimensions and Beyond

**Authors:** Shang-Qiang Ning, Xing-Yu Ren, Qing-Rui Wang, Yang Qi, Zheng-Cheng Gu

**Year:** 2025 | **Venue:** arXiv | **Citations:** N/A | **Score:** 0.000

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25069v1) | > Although classification for free-fermion topological superconductors (TSC) is established, systematically understanding the classification of 3D interacting TSCs remains difficult, especially those protected by crystalline symmetries like the 230 space groups. We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discre...

## 590. From Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing

**Authors:** Xu He, Haoxian Zhang, Hejia Chen, Changyuan Zheng, Liyang Chen

**Year:** 2025 | **Venue:** arXiv | **Citations:** N/A | **Score:** 0.000

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25066v1) | > Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simulta...

## 591. Feeling Blue: Constructing a Robust SALT3 UV Template and Constraining its Redshift Dependency

**Year:** 2025 | **Venue:** arXiv | **Citations:** N/A | **Score:** 0.000

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25064v1) | > Upcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical--UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, includin...

## 592. The PDE-ODI principle and cylindrical mean curvature flows

**Authors:** Richard H. Bamler, Yi Lai

**Year:** 2025 | **Venue:** arXiv | **Citations:** N/A | **Score:** 0.000

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25050v1) | > We introduce a new approach for analyzing ancient solutions and singularities of mean curvature flow that are locally modeled on a cylinder. Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \emph{PDE--ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used...

## 593. All optical Lithography for Spatiotemporal Patterning of Azopolymer Microreliefs

**Authors:** I Komang Januariyasa, Francesco Reda, Nikolai Liubimtsev, Marina Saphiannikova, Fabio Borbone

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25048v1) | > Microstructured surfaces are central to photonics, biointerfaces, and functional coatings, yet they are typically fabricated through multi-step lithographic workflows requiring masks or molds and post-processing. Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth...

## 594. Anomalous (3+1)d Fermionic Topological Quantum Field Theories via Symmetry Extension

**Authors:** Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang

**Year:** 2025 | **Venue:** arXiv | **Citations:** N/A | **Score:** 0.000

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25038v1) | > Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Wey...

## 595. Perturbative Kondo destruction and global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals

**Authors:** Yiming Wang, Shouvik Sur, Chia-Chuan Liu, Qimiao Si

**Year:** 2025 | **Venue:** arXiv | **Citations:** N/A | **Score:** 0.000

[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.25036v1) | > Strange metals represent a foundational problem in quantum condensed matter physics, and heavy fermion systems provide a canonical setting to advance a general understanding. The concept of a Kondo destruction quantum critical point is widely invoked to describe the competition of the Kondo effect and the local-moment magnetism. Here, we develop a unified field-theoretic approach, analyzing this c...
